It is an application for management and billing purposes of medicines as a customer or an admin. It keeps a record of the available medicines and the medicines which are in demand. Also it allows only the admin to update the medicines which are available or if out of stock. Customer is able to add medicines to the cart, search the medicines, see their information and then checkout. The user is authenticated either as admin or customer. 
The idea is somewhat similar to Online pharmacy store.
